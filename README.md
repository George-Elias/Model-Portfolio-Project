# Optimised Indian Equity and Debt Mutual Fund Portfolio

## Objective
This project mirrors the analytical workflow of a junior buy-side analyst evaluating equity mutual funds for different investor profiles.

The goal is not to maximize past returns, but to identify **consistent, risk-adjusted portfolio aligned with specific investor objectives**.

---

## Investment Philosophy
- Past performance is not predictive, but **performance persistence and
  risk behavior provide useful signals**
- Fund evaluation must consider **market cycles**, not point-in-time returns
- Quantitative metrics are necessary but insufficient without qualitative judgment

---

## Scope of Analysis
- Universe: Indian equity mutual funds (Large Cap, Flexi Cap, Mid Cap)
- Time horizon: Rolling 3Y and 5Y analysis
- Benchmark comparison: Category benchmarks and NIFTY indices
- Investor profiles: Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive equity investors
